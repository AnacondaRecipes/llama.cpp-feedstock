Subject: [PATCH] metal gpu selection

In macOS, in order for the system to provide a default Metal device object, you must link to the Core Graphics framework. 
You usually need to do this explicitly if you’re writing apps that don’t use graphics by default, such as command line tools.
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/1433401-mtlcreatesystemdefaultdevice?language=objc
Systems with Apple silicon only have one GPU, which removes the need to choose a GPU.
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldevice/1433409-lowpower#discussion

I did try linking to CoreGraphics, but MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice was still returning nil.
